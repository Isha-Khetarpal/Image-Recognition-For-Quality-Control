# Image-Recognition-For-Quality-Control
 This Defect Detection System uses YOLOv8 and computer vision to detect flaws in products like shampoo bottles, identifying dents, scratches, and labeling errors. With a Flask-based interface for image uploads or real-time camera inspection, the GPU-optimized system offers an efficient solution for automated quality control in manufacturing.
Steps to run the project:-
i)Download python 3.8.10
ii)Download the repository and extract it in your system.
iii)Make sure to adjust all the paths as per your desired location.
iv)Then run the requirements.txt file in your terminal to download all the necessary libraries.
v)The Yolov8.pynb is the model training file you need not to change it.
vi)In order to run the project , open the terminal and type python app.py , after that an ip address will be displayed on which you have to click and open it in your browser.
vii)Once the project is open you are good to go , you can upload the photo of shampoo bottles and identify the defects , the model will show you the desired results.
